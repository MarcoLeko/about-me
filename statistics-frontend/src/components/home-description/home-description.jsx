        getting more important to ensure equal standards and overcome financial
        and cultural boundaries. There are huge inequalities between nations,
        that's why member states of the United Nations Sustainable Development
        Summit formally adopted the{" "}
        <Link href="https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda">
          2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.{" "}
        </Link>
        This framework helps to guide governments and partners on how to turn
        commitments into action. The agenda contains 17 goals including a new
        global education goal (SDG 4). SDG 4 is designed to ensure inclusive and
        equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities
        for all. - source:{" "}
